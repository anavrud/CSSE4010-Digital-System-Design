# CSSE4010 Digital System Design
The objective of this course is to give the students the theoretical basis and practical skills in modern design of medium size digital systems in various technologies, with a focus on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design methodology, systematically introduced and used in the course, is based on simulation and synthesis with hardware description language (VHDL) tools. Topics covered in this course include: conceptual design step from requirements and specification to simulation and synthesis model in VHDL, design of complex controllers with Finite State Machines, design of sequential blocks with Controller-Datapath methodology, issues in design for testability, electrical and timing issues in logic and system design, overview of implementation technologies with emphasis on advances in FPGAs.
