# CSSE4010 Digital System Design

## Course Overview
The objective of this course is to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in modern design of medium-sized digital systems across various technologies, with a specific focus on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). 

### Key Topics:
- Conceptual design process: From requirements and specifications to simulation and synthesis in VHDL.
- Design of complex controllers using Finite State Machines (FSM).
- Design of sequential blocks with Controller-Datapath methodology.
- Design for testability and related challenges.
- Electrical and timing issues in logic and system design.
- Overview of various implementation technologies, with an emphasis on FPGA advancements.

The course is based on a systematic methodology that integrates simulation and synthesis, using hardware description language (VHDL) tools.
